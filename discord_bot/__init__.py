"""
AudioViz Discord Bot

Discord bot for audio streaming and synchronization.
Captures mixed voice channel audio and streams it to the AudioViz
processor for real-time visualization in Minecraft.

Note: This is NOT used for local audio capture — WASAPI handles that.
The Discord bot is for streaming remote audio sources (voice channels)
and synchronizing visualization across distributed setups.
